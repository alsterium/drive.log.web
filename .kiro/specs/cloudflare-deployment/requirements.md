# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves configuring the existing Next.js application to be deployable to Cloudflare Pages. The application currently uses Next.js 15.2.4 with various UI components and needs to be adapted to work with Cloudflare's edge runtime environment. This includes updating the build configuration, adding necessary adapters, and ensuring compatibility with Cloudflare's deployment requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my Next.js application to Cloudflare Pages, so that I can leverage Cloudflare's global CDN and edge computing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL generate static files compatible with Cloudflare Pages
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL use the @cloudflare/next-on-pages adapter
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL serve all static assets correctly from Cloudflare's CDN
4. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL load without any runtime errors related to Cloudflare compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Next.js application to use static export mode, so that it can be deployed as static files to Cloudflare Pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL enable static export mode
2. WHEN the build runs THEN the system SHALL generate an `out` directory with static files
3. WHEN static files are generated THEN the system SHALL include all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
4. WHEN the application uses dynamic routes THEN the system SHALL pre-generate all possible static paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure proper build scripts and dependencies, so that the deployment process works seamlessly with Cloudflare Pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is updated THEN the system SHALL include @cloudflare/next-on-pages as a dependency
2. WHEN build scripts are configured THEN the system SHALL include a cloudflare-specific build command
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL execute wrangler pages build command successfully
4. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL include all necessary Cloudflare-specific packages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure image optimization works correctly, so that images load properly in the Cloudflare environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL use unoptimized mode for Cloudflare compatibility
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display all images without broken links
3. WHEN image components are used THEN the system SHALL not rely on Next.js server-side image optimization
4. WHEN static export runs THEN the system SHALL include all image assets in the output directory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure environment-specific settings, so that the application behaves correctly in both development and production on Cloudflare.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL support Cloudflare Pages environment variable configuration
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the system SHALL use appropriate base paths and asset prefixes
3. WHEN API routes are used THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Cloudflare Workers runtime
4. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate configuration for Cloudflare's edge environment
